A semantic text search means that instead of simply looking for the exact keywords from the question, we are looking for text that is most similar to the question across a number of dimensions. If semantic search means finding the most similar text, how do we measure that similarity? We need to define a measurement of \"distance\", and whichever piece of text has the shortest distance is the most similar. There are many ways to measure distance when we go beyond 1-dimensional data. Which one should we use for our chatbot? Since, we are using OpenAI API, it recommend to use cosine similarity. \n",
